JXLS
====

JXLS is an ObjC++ wrapper and framework for xlslib. xlslib is a C++/C library to construct Microsoft Excel™ .xls files in code. 

This Framework is based on the xlslib open source project and includes it as a git submodule.

To configure this project, you should 

	git submodule update --init --recursive

after cloning from within your JXLS git repo.

The xlconfig.h file was produced by doing a "./bootstrap" inside the root xlslib folder - you can replace it with the same if you wish. This library has only been tested on 64-bit Intel as it uses ARC.

There is an Xcode project for building on iOS, but it is not actively maintained. If it doesn’t *just work* please fix and send a pull request!

Updating
--------

If you have been using JXLS versions before 1.0, you will have to change your imports to the umbrella header used in 1.0+:

    #import <JXLS/JXLS.h>

Usage
-----

You can integrate JXLS into your project via CocoaPods or manually as described below. 

Add “JXLS.xcodeproj” to your project (preferably into “Frameworks” to keep things tidy).

###Xcode 4

In your target’s “Build Phases”:

* Add Build Phase (+-button pull-down menu) > Copy Files
* Destination: Frameworks
* Change name to “Copy Frameworks” to keep things clean

###Xcode 5 or 6

In your target’s “Build Phases”:

* Editor (menu) > Add Build Phase > Add Copy Files Build Phase
* Destination: Frameworks
* Change name to “Copy Frameworks” to keep things clean

###Both

Add “JXLS.framework” to the following build phases (via the +-buttons):

* “Target Dependencies”
* “Link Binary With Libraries”
* “Copy Frameworks” (created above)

And finally import the header in your code:

    #import <JXLS/JXLS.h>
