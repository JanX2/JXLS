Notes:

- this project allows you to both create a Framework called DHxls, and to build a test file that uses it

- to configure this project, you must svn the xlslib library source from the svn repository on sourceforge, and place the xlslib folder inside the DHxls folder (where this README exists)

- the xlconfig.h file was produced by doing a "./bootstrap" inside the xlslib folder - you can replace it with the same if you wish. This library has only been tested 32 bits on Intel, but should work on PPC and in 64 bit (but then, who knows)

- one user has told me he got this FRAMEWORK and xlslib to work on the iPhone!
